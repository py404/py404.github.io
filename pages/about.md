## **About Me**

Hello there! :wave:.

My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**. I am a Scientist (Data and Analytics) and a Software Developer (both :desktop_computer: and :iphone:) working at Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR) in Christchurch, New Zealand :new_zealand:. My work if focused around environment, public health and science.

I have a strong passion for technology. I blog mostly about Python, R, Django, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Software Development, Big Data and lot more. Python and R are my go to tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistics and machine learning. I blog and pin them down here in chronological order. Feel free to read a bit more about me.

The toolset I use is quite an array of tech like Python, R, Jupyter notebooks, RShiny, SQL (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, LiteDB), Flask, Django, React JS, Git & GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Azure DevOps, PowerBI, Tableau for my day to day tasks and other workflows.

A list of my projects are under the Projects tab. You may also check out my GitHub profile.
