## **About Me**

Hello there! :wave:.

My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**. I am a Scientist (Data and Analytics) and a Software Developer (both :desktop_computer: and :iphone:) working at Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR) in Christchurch, New Zealand :new_zealand:. My current work is focused in environment, public health and science.

I have a strong passion for technology. I blog mostly about Web development and Data Science in general. Python and R are my go to tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistics and machine learning. I blog and pin them in chronological order in "Blog" tab. The toolset I use is quite an array of tech like Python, R, Jupyter notebooks, RShiny, SQL (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/), Flask, Django, React JS, Git & GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Azure DevOps, PowerBI, Tableau for my day to day tasks and other workflows.

A list of my projects are under the Projects tab. You may also check out my GitHub profile.
