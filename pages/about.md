## **About Me**

Hello there! :wave:.

My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**. I am a Software Developer (:desktop_computer: and :iphone:) and a Data Science Generalist living in New Zealand. I am currently working as a **Product Owner & Analytics Specialist** at **Spark New Zealand** (Christchurch) :new_zealand: in the **AI & Engineering Tribe**. My current work is focused in the Telecom industry, helping to build cutting edge analytical and data science web applications in React, Python, and R Shiny.

I have a strong passion for technology. I blog mostly about Web development and Data Science in general. Python and R are my go to tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistics and machine learning. I blog and pin them in chronological order in "Blog" tab. 

The toolset I use for most of my work is in - Python, FastAPI, R + R Shiny, Jupyter notebooks, SQL, Snowflake, NoSQL (MongoDB), React & NextJS, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Azure DevOps, and PowerBI.

A list of my projects are under the Projects tab. You may also check out my GitHub profile.
