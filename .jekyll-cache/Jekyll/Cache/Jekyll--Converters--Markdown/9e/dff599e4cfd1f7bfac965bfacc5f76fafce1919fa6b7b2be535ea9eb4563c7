<p>I studied Bachelors in Computer Science at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India. After my degree, I started my career as Google Maps Labeler at Google Maps office, Hyderabad, India and then as a Trainee Software Engineer at Accenture, Bengaluru, India. Later I moved to Christchurch, New Zealand to pursue postgraduate studies in Advanced Networked Engineering at Whitireia New Zealand in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>

I was the only IT engineer at the company, supporting around 30 staff with IT related issues and maintained the internal infrastructure from Active Directory to managing windows servers, SQL databases and MySQL databases, in-house developed windows applications, printers etc. I also developed in-house windows applications using C# and SQL Server or MySQL database backends and a web application <strong><a href="http://mycatchment.info/" target="_blank">mycatchment.info</a></strong> that is used by the local farmers in New Zealand to find out information for irrigation planning, consenting and design.</p>
