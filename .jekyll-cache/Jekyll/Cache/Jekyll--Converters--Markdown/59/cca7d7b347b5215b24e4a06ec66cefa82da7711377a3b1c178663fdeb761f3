<h1 id="career-and-education">Career and Education</h1>
<p>My name is Phani Atmakur and I am a Data Scientist at Institute of Environmental Science &amp; Research (ESR), Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>

<p>I studied Bachelors in Computer Science at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India. After my degree, I started my career as Google Maps Labeler at Google Maps office, Hyderabad, India and then as a Trainee Software Engineer at Accenture, Bengaluru, India. Later I moved to Christchurch, New Zealand to pursue postgraduate studies in Advanced Networked Engineering at Whitireia New Zealand in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>

<p>After postgraduate studies I landed my first role as a Systems &amp; Applications Engineer at CDHB (Canterbury District Health Board) supporting Active Directory, Group Policies, packaging MSI and App-V applications for Windows and Virtual infrastructure, managing Microsoft Windows Servers and SQL databases, Unix/Linux systems. Later moved to a similar role at Canterbury Health Labs (CHL, part of CDHB) and involved in supporting crucial laboratory and clinical applications as well.</p>

<p>Later I moved to Aqualinc Research Limited as a Software and Systems Engineer role in Christchurch. I was the only IT engineer at the company, supporting around 30 staff with IT related issues and maintained the internal infrastructure from Active Directory to managing in-house windows servers, SQL databases and MySQL databases. I also developed in-house windows applications using C# and SQL Server or MySQL database backends. I developed a web application <strong>mycatchment.info (http://mycatchment.info/)</strong> that is used by the local farmers in New Zealand to find out information for irrigation planning, consenting and design.</p>
