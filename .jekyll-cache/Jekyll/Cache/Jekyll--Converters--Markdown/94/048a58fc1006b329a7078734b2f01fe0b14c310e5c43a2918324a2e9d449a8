<p>In this jupyter notebook I documented web scraping and exploratory data analysis using Python 3.</p>

<p>The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>use Pythonâ€™s requests and bs4 libraries to scrape a webpage</li>
  <li>load the scraped data into a pandas dataframe</li>
  <li>do some basic exploratory data anlaysis on the dataframe</li>
  <li>basic visualization</li>
</ol>

<p>For this articleâ€™s purpose I scraped population data of New Zealand as of June 30, 2018 from <a href="http://citypopulation.de">http://citypopulation.de</a> website.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please note there might be some policies and rules for a website for using the data. So before you do the web scraping please do not forget to read the data usage policies.</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://citypopulation.de/termsofuse.html">Data use policy:</a> (DATA -&gt; Population Data)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am only scraping data for North and South Islands (excluded Chatham islands)</li>
  <li>North island: <a href="http://citypopulation.de/en/newzealand/northisland/">http://citypopulation.de/en/newzealand/northisland/</a></li>
  <li>South island: <a href="http://citypopulation.de/en/newzealand/southisland/">http://citypopulation.de/en/newzealand/southisland/</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="final-note">Final note</h1>

<p>Please note that I documented this jupyter notebook for a simple way to explain how useful it is using requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4) libraries to scrape website data .</p>

<p>Feel free to do your own exploration and analysis on the data that is scraped.</p>

<p>I hope that this piece of work will give readers some basic understanding of web scraping and intuition behind the analysis, which is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>from scraping data to end-to-end data analysis (if I might say in simple words or may be not)</li>
</ul>
