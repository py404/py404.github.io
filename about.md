# Career and Education
My name is Phani Atmakur and I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR), Christchurch, New Zealand.

## A little background
I studied Bachelors in Computer Science at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India. After my degree, I started my career as Google Maps Labeler at Google Maps office, Hyderabad, India and then as a Trainee Software Engineer at Accenture, Bengaluru, India. Later I moved to Christchurch, New Zealand to pursue postgraduate studies in Advanced Networked Engineering at Whitireia New Zealand in Christchurch, New Zealand.

### CDHB Story
After postgraduate studies I landed my first role as a Systems & Applications Engineer at CDHB (Canterbury District Health Board) supporting Active Directory, Group Policies, packaging MSI and App-V applications for Windows and Virtual infrastructure, managing Microsoft Windows Servers and SQL databases, Unix/Linux systems. Later moved to a similar role at Canterbury Health Labs (CHL, part of CDHB) and involved in supporting crucial laboratory and clinical applications as well. 

### Aqualinc Story
Later I moved to Aqualinc Research Limited as a Software and Systems Engineer role in Christchurch. I was the only IT engineer at the company, supporting around 30 staff with IT related issues and maintained the internal infrastructure from Active Directory to managing windows servers, SQL databases and MySQL databases, in-house developed windows applications, printers etc. I also developed in-house windows applications using C# and SQL Server or MySQL database backends and a web application **[mycatchment.info](http://mycatchment.info/){:target="_blank"}** that is used by the local farmers in New Zealand to find out information for irrigation planning, consenting and design. 

### CHL story
Further I developed my interest in Business Intelligence and Data related areas and moved to Canterbury Health Labs as a BI (Business Intelligence) and Applications Developer. I was involved in data analysis, developing Tableau reports and dashboards. I developed few in-house applications for laboratory staff.

1. PyBarcode - a barcode labels printing application that connects to laboratory database and prints a barcode with identifiers on it. The purpose is to use the barcode labels for sample tubes, documents and many other uses.

2. Interlab PyBarcode - a web application that downloads images from other laboratories and adds a barcode on top of the downloaded image using Python's PILLOW and OpenCV libraries. Application was developed in C# using Web API and Python to run the Pillow and OpenCV operations. 

### ESR story
After working at CHL for 2 years I moved to ESR as a Data Scientist. Currently we are a team of 4 people with different backgrounds working in Environment, Health and other science areas. I majorly focus on Python and R to do data analysis, EDA, visualization and building machine learning models. Apart from that I also use Power BI and Tableau to create reports and dashboards, Flask and Django for creating web applications.

# Hobbies
I enjoy traveling, photography and good food. As much as I travel, I also crave for good food all the time. You can checkout my instagram profile here: **[dna_lad](https://instagram.com/dna_lad){:target="_blank"}**

Apart from that I am geek as well. I love to upgrade my skillset all the time and I am currently investing my time in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
